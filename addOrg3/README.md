## Adding Org3 to the fabric network

Step-1: You first need to run `./start.sh` in the `LAND-DATABASE` directory before you can run the `addOrg3.sh` script.

Step-2: You can use the `addOrg3.sh` script to add another organization to the Fabric test network. 
    The `addOrg3.sh` script generates the Org3 crypto material, creates an Org3 organization definition, up the Org3 docker container and adds Org3 to a channel on the test network.

Step-3: Execute `step1org3.sh` and `step2org3.sh` script.
